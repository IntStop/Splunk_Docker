Want to get going and see the value of this image? Using the following getting started guide, https://github.com/splunk/docker-gettingstarted-conf2016.

## List of Technical Add-ons
1. ta-dockerlogs_fileinput: Uses Splunk's File & Directories monitoring to monitor all files generated by the docker json-file driver.  Please read the following docker logging drivers documentation to learn more about the logging options in docker, https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/.

2. ta-dockerstats:  Uses [Docker Remote API](https://docker.github.io/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api/) to collect Inspect, Top, and Events in Splunk;  This TA is also used to correlate container ids collected by the ta-dockerlogs_fileinput.

3. ta-ucplogs-sysloginput: is used to transform the UCP syslog (TCP/UDP) data in to a ucp source that can be more efficiently analyzed in Splunk.<br>
